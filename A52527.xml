            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE EPISTLE To the READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Book, being formerly publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the proper and genuine Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, had, as it well deserved, good accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Author and the Work mutually adding to each others Esteem. And herein the Matter was no less profitable, than the Manner usefull and ingenious: So that this only, of all the Books of Law (as concerning the Method) is without Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
<pb facs="tcp:33044:3"/> Herein you may find a triple relation distinguished by the various Print. In the first, you have the Maxims and posi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tive grounds of the Law, with whatsoever is added or expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Statutes concerning the same, Which taken apart, will afford a continual sensible dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. In the second is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the proofs and examples of those Maxims. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that precious Flower of the Crown, the Kings Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, may not be valued in the hands of a common person, such Cases as concern the King ore severed from the rest.</p>
            <p>To impart good is to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, which was one cause of the translation of this Book yet is it not thereby made so facile as to deseend to vulgar capacities; witness the very
<pb facs="tcp:33044:3"/> phrase, the terms of Art, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all hope of accrue to Lay-conceited opinions. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther speaketh it at adventure, but as the Author taught, and no otherwise; whose fame will affirm, and none will deny, but that he best knew how to fit and adorn his own Work.</p>
            <p>Now remaineth only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate the faults, either those material in the Copy, or literal in the Print, the first a judicious Reader is able to supply, a little labour will correct the rest: He that is courteous will remit both. To plot and to perfect at once, is to be more than man. Such was the pain to compose, that the Child wasted its own Parent therein, nevertheless being unhappy preventing the blessing of Perfection, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming an Abortive; But be
<pb facs="tcp:33044:4"/> you the Guardian, so much It invites, the Author merits more. His proposed end was to enrich others by this expression of his love, cover therefore the faults occasioned by an Error of Love, and redeem Him, that for your sake is imbarqued in the common Censure of all Men.</p>

                  <hi>These are twofold, like those two great lights, which God hath set in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our heart. Nature and Reason;</hi> For being proper to a man, as he is a man and reasonable creature, they may be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as reason it self is divided. They that have travelled most in the grounds of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, distinguish that excellent faculty of Reason (which of all earthly creatures man only hath) into two other faculties, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or the mind, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or the reasoning part: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> they call that faculty of the soul that offereth unto us things clear &amp; light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of themselves, without any further reasoning or discourse. By <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> they mean that faculty of the soul, that by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of reason doth deduce &amp; draw one thing from another. From hence the mast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and professors of the art of reason, make judgment (which is the flower of all reason, &amp; in effect nothing else but <hi>ratio conjuncta,</hi> reason set together) to be <hi>Noeticum</hi> or <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anoeticum.</hi> We by their example may distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish those which we call Native Laws, and are the foundation of all other laws, into Primitive, which is that they call <hi>Noe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum,</hi> we, the law of Nature; or secondary rules of reason, which is their <hi>Dianoeticum,</hi> with us the Law of reason.

                  <p>Departure also, when one fortifieth not the matter of his plea that went before, but cometh in with a new matter, is a kind of variance, and maketh the plea naught. As if the rejoynder be a matter puisne under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the matter of his bar, and not above, and going before it: As in an action of Trespass, the defendant pleadeth a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent unto him of the land, the plaintiff saith, that after the descent the defendant infeoffed him: Now if the defendant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn, that the feoffment was upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and he entered for the condition broken; this is a departure: for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the bar (that is, the descent) is before the matter of the rejoynder, that is to say, the entry for the condition bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, whereby the feoffment is avoided. So if in an assize the defendant pleadeth the feoffment of I. S. and the plaintiff make title to himself by descent, and that he was disseised by I. S. who infeoffed the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant; or that he infeoffed I.S. upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, who b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ake the condition, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:33044:30"/> infeoffed the defendant, &amp;c. Now if the defendant say, that after the disseisin (or condition broken) and after the feoffment of I. S. to the defendant, the plaintiff did release to the defendant, or confirm the state of the defendant, this is a departure; for that is a matter that groweth after the feoffment pleaded in bar. But if he plead such a release or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation from the plaintiff to I. S. that is no departure; for it is a matter before the feoffment, or in an action of trespass for goods, if the defendant entitle himself by the gift of I. S. and the plaintiff saith that himself was possessed till I. S. took them from him and gave them to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant. Now the defendant may say, that after the taking, the plaintiff gave them to I. S. who gave them to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant: For although the defendant might have pleaded these things at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; yet, in as much as it is pursuing, and fortifieth his bar, and no puisne mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter undernearh the title of his bar, but eigne, and above the matter of his bar, therefore it is no departure. So a plea in a bar which is intendible at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, cannot be maintained by a matter of custom, or by Statute Law. As in an assize the tenant pleadeth in bar a devise unto himself of the land, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visable by the custom: the plaintiff saith, that the Devisor was within age at the time of the Devisee. Now if the Tenant say, that by the custom there, an Infant
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:33044:31"/> of fifteen years of age may make a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise: this is a departure. For the custom pleaded in bar shall be intended of those that may make a devise by the Common Law. So if in an action of trespass the defendant plead in bar a release for fifty years from a house of Religion, and the plaintiff avoid it, by reason it was made within a year before the dissolution, and so void by the Statute 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. Now if the defendant will alledge, that by the same Statute it is provided, that all such leases shall be good for xxi years, and so main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Lease to be good for so many years, this is a departure. Or if one plead a Fine, and that being avoided because the parties to the fine had nothing, will maintain the Fine to be good by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute 11 <hi>R.</hi> 3. because he that levied the Fine was <hi>Cestui qui <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The place is very notable, it openeth the original and first beginning of the Common Law, it shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the antiquity of the name, in effect all one with that which since and by a later name is called <hi>Jus civile (quod quisque po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pul'ipse sibi jus constituit,</hi> as <hi>Justinian</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) it teacheth Common Law to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but common reason: but what reason? not that which every one doth frame unto himself; but refined reason, <hi>Quae cum adolevit atque perfecta est nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur rite sapientia,</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi> saith, and as <hi>Plato</hi> there hath it, when it cometh to be <hi>opinionor decretum.</hi> How: generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the consent of all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore Laws positive, which are directly contrary to the former, lose their force, and are no Laws at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As those which are contrary to the Law of nature. Such was that of the Egyptians, to turn women to merchandize, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth affairs, and men to keep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doors. And of the Thracians, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted idleness an honest thing, and stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling very comme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>dable. So if it were made a law, that men might commit adultery, forge false deeds, &amp;c. And this is manifest unto all men. But because the Law of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is known only to such as are able to judge aright, and that but imperfectly (as
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:33044:43"/> before was shewed) therefore here the case is harder, what laws may be said agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and what repugnant thereunto. Only in general (which is sufficient for this place and purpose) it is truly said, and all men must agree, that law in deed repugnant to the law of reason, are aswell void, as those that cross the law of nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Positive Laws are sundry and divers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the several and divers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of particular places and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such among the Jews were their Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals, delivered by <hi>Moses,</hi> which so far as they be positive, bind us not unto them. Such were the antient law of the Grecians, the xii. tables, and civil laws of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, and <hi>Such are the common Laws of</hi> England. And almost so many people so many Laws. And as those Laws are divers one from another, so one and the self same Laws may be altered and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in themselves, so long as no alteration is permitted against the two main Laws of Nature and Reason.</p>

                  <hi>And therefore</hi> carrying Gods stamp and mark among men, and being, as one may say, a God upon earth, as God is a King in Heaven: <hi>hath</hi> a shadow of <hi>the excellencies that are in God,</hi> in a similitudinary sort <hi>given him.</hi> Gods excellencies and honour stand partly in things incommunicable unto other, partly in such as after a sort he maketh his creatures partakers of both: which the King is said to have, some in truth, others by fiction, all by similitude from the divine perfection.</p>
               <p>The first thing in God, and most proper to his sacred Majesty, is the infiniteness of his nature; who, as the philosopher ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly saith, only is that Circle, <hi>cujus cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum estubi{que} peripheria nusquam.</hi> So say our books, that the King in a manner is every where, and present in all his Courts.</p>
               <p>In a writ of error upon a false Judgment given for the King,<note place="margin">F. N. B. <hi>21.</hi> b.</note> no <hi>Scire facias</hi> shall go forth <hi>ad audiendum errores,</hi> for the King is always present in Court; &amp; that is the cause that the form of entry in all suits for the King is <hi>Henricus Hobart miles, Attornatus domini Regis generalis, qui pro domino

                  <hi>Dominus Rex per Henricum Hobart Attornatum suum,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore it is also, that the King cannot be <hi>non suit;</hi> that all acts of Parliament, which concern the King or General, and the Court must take notice without pleading of them, for he is in all, and all have their part in him.</p>
               <p>A second thing proper unto God, is the divine perfection. In the King no imperfect thing can be thought, no<note n="(a)" place="margin">35 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 26.</note> negligence, or laches, no folly, no infamy, no stain or corruption of blood.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A simple Baylment,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">5 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 18.</note>
                  <hi>when he receiveth them to keep for another: whether it be for the Bailor to re-deliver him again:</hi> in which case the Bailor may retake them without request: <hi>or for a stranger to bayl them over to him.</hi> In which case,<note place="margin">1 <hi>E.</hi> 5. 2.</note> before such bayling over, the Bailor may coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termand the Bailment, and command the Bailee to deliver them him again, and shall have an account upon refusal. For in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these cases the property is out of the Bailor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A pledge is when he receiveth</hi>

But the property of the pledge remaineth in the owner; for he shall bear it, if it be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually lost or broken: and the other that bath the pledge, shall not be attached by it, in as much as he is not owner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The baylment of goods to employ is, when the Bailee hath the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to use to anothers profit.</hi> As to sell <hi>meliori modo quo poterit, &amp;c.</hi> Where, if he sell that for 12 <hi>l.</hi> which is worth 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and refuse a better price, the party hath no remedy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Contract is a mutual agreement for the very property of personal things, where the duty growing upon it cannot be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned.</hi> As if I sell my own horse and the horse of I. S. to one for x <hi>l.</hi> and I.S taketh his horse from the vendee, yet the vendee must pay me the whole x <hi>l. Of this kind of contracts are buying and sell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, borrowing and lending, and such like.</hi> and in all these cases an action of debt lieth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The sale of another mans goods in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen market</hi> (we call it market overt) without Covin or notice whose they are, <hi>altereth the property, if toll be paid for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hither belong certain (as it were) contracts in Law, though
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:33044:95"/> not arising from the special agreement of the parties.</hi> As he that findeth anothers goods, is chargeable by reason of the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session to him that right hath: he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth money to ones use, or to deliver over to him, is chargeable as a receiver. He that entreth into land of his own head, and receiveth the profits of it, or parents that occupie land purchased by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, are chargeable as Bayliffs. And if a Liberate be delivered to the Clark of the Hamper, who hath assets in his hands, an action of debt lieth againh him. So doth it upon every judgement.</p>

So of Waste, detinue of charters of land, which are things in realty, annuity, &amp;c. they lie not in arbitrement or concord.</p>
               <p>

               <p>This ouster is of a Freeholder in Deed or in Law. Of the first sort are Intrusion or Abatement.</p>

               <p>Forestaller is, when the Tenant beset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the way with force and Arms upon his coming. Of which nature also is the menacing of him that for doubt of some bodily hurt, <hi>death or loss of member</hi> he dare not come.</p>

               <p>A <hi>Real <hi>Praecipe quod reddat</hi> is that which is for real things in render; and is a plea of land, or other such real <hi>Praecipe.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>plea of land which is for land or other such things in demesne, where land in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is demanded, it must always be brought in a ville, or place known out of any ville;</hi> and not in a hamlet which is parcel of a ville. But personal actions, as trespasses, and such like, may be in a hamlet. So of Dower and Assise; for there no land in certain is demanded; and also in an Assise, he shall recover by view of the Jury. So in a <hi>Scire facias</hi> out of a fine <hi>nuper obiit,</hi> a writ of mesne, covenant, waste, <hi>quare impedit.</hi> These may be in a hamlet. Otherwise it is of a writ of right of Advowson.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A plea of land is a writ of Entry, or a writ shewing the Demandants title.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A writ of Entry is that which is to disprove the Tenants possession by the means of his entry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherein Tenant in Fee-simple de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of the possession of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, shall say in the writ,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A Writ of Entry is either against the first party, or in the degrees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Against the first party, when it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him to whom the first alienation was, or that made the first disseisin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That in the degrees is in the</hi> Per, <hi>or in the</hi> Per <hi>and</hi> Cui.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>In the</hi> Per <hi>and</hi> Cui, <hi>when he against whom it is brought cometh in immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the first parties heir or alienee:</hi> For if more than these two alienations (the <hi>Per,</hi> or the <hi>Per</hi> and <hi>Cui</hi>) pass, the deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant is driven to his writ of right. And the reason is, that there may be an end of suits. For no writ of Entry in the <hi>Post</hi> lay at the Common Law, but the same is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Statute of <hi>Marlbridge, c.</hi> 29. Which writ of Entry in the <hi>Post</hi> given now by that Statute lieth, when he against whom it is brought cometh in, neither in the <hi>Per,</hi> nor <hi>Per</hi> and <hi>Cui,</hi> then the writ shall be <hi>In quod, &amp;c. nisi post dimissionem, &amp;c.</hi> Out of all degrees, as by Abatement, Disseisin, Escheat, Recovery, Election, Succession, Dower, Judgment, &amp;c. or as the third or more Feoffees.</p>
               <p>The form of all which is thus. In a writ of Entry, in the nature of an Assise, against the party himself that did the disseisin,

               <p>

                  <hi>Et hoc patro natus est verificare,</hi> which we call an averment. But no averment need to be in avowry, for it is in lieu of a Count and Declaration. And the avowant is in a manner actor and Plaintiff, and to have a return.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An advantage of a matter which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pleaded, shall be saved by protesting not acknowledgeng it to be true, although matter pleaded pass against him.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Pleas are either of the defendant when he is first brought in to answer, or the mutual pleas of both.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of Trespass or an Assise, if the Defendant claim by a lease from the Plaintiff to <hi>A.</hi> who granteth his term to <hi>B.</hi> and to <hi>B.</hi> the
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:33044:201"/> Defendant, the Plaintiff must answer only to his own Lease, for the assignments of <hi>A.</hi> are but conveyances, and not material. But in an assise, if the Defendant derive his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest from a stranger, and that <hi>A.</hi> was seised and enseoffed <hi>B.</hi> who enfeoffed <hi>C.</hi> and <hi>C.</hi> the Tenant: there the Plaintiff may traverse any of the mean Conveyances, for they are all material.</p>
               <p>Therefore repugnance of a Plea unto it self is a fault in pleading, as in an action of Trespass of his house, and walls broken down, the Defendant cannot plead touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the house, not guilty, and as to the breaking down of the walls justifie, for this carrieth a repugnancy in it, in as much as the house and the wall are all one thing.</p>
               <p>So is a departure, where he forfeiteth not the matter of his plea that went before, but cometh in with a new matter. As if the rejoynder be a matter puisne, underneath the matter of his bar, not above and going before it. As in an action of Trespass, the Defendant pleadeth a discent unto him of the Land, the Plaintiff saith, that after the descent the Defendant enfeoffed him. Now if the Defendant rejoyn that the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offment was upon conditon, and he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred for the condition broken; this is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture for the matter of the bar, that is, the discent, is before the matter of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder, that is to say, the entry for the condition broken, whereby the feoffment is avoided. So in an assise, the Defendant
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:33044:202"/> pleadeth the feoffement of <hi>J. S.</hi> and the Plaintiff make title to himself by discent, and that he was disseised by <hi>J. S.</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feoffed the Demandant, or that he enfeoffed <hi>J. S.</hi> upon condition, who brake the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and afterwards enfeoffed the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now if the Defendant say that after the disseisin (or condition broken) and after the feoffment of <hi>I. S.</hi> to the Defendant, the Plaintiff did release to the Defendant, or confirm the estate of the Defendant, this is a departure, for that is a matter that grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after the feoffment pleaded in Bar. But if he plead such a release or confirmation from the Plaintiff to <hi>I. S.</hi> that is no depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for it is a matter before the feoffment, or in an action of trespass for goods, if the Defendant title himself by the gift of <hi>I. S.</hi> and the Plaintiff saith, that himself was possessed till <hi>I. S.</hi> took them from him, and gave them to the Defendant. Now the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant may say, that after the taking the Plaintiff gave them to <hi>I. S.</hi> who gave them to the Defendant; for although the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant might have pleaded these things at the beginning, yet in as much as it is pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and fortifieth his Bar, and no puis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e matter underneath the title of his Bar, but eigne, and above the matter of his Bar, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no departure. So a plea in Bar which is intendible at the Common Law, cannot be maintained by a matter of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, or by Statute-Law. As in an assise the
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:33044:202"/> tenant pleadeth in bar a devise unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of the Land being devisible by the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, the Plaintiff saith that the Devisor was within age at the time of the devise. Now if the Tenant said that by the custom there an infant of fifteen years of age may make a devise: This is a departure, for the custom pleaded in bar shall be intended of those that may make a devise by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law. So if in an action of Trespass the Defendant plead in bar a lease for fifty years from a house of Religion, and the Plaintiff avoid it by reason it was made within a year before the dissolution, and so void by the Statute 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. Now if the Defendant will alledge that by the same Statute it is provided that all such leases shall be good for 21 years, and so maintain the lease to be good for so many years, this is a depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: or if one plead a fine, and that being avoided, because the parties to the fine had nothing, will maintain the fine to be good by the Statute 1 <hi>R.</hi> 3. because he had levied the fine <hi>cesti qui use.</hi> Lastly, when matters are pleaded which offer several issues, that is termed a double plea, and is a fault in pleading. As in an assise to plead a feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Ancestor with Warranty. In debt upon a simple contract to plead pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and an acquittance. In an assise to plead divers descents of the Land in fee-simple, for every of them requireth a seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral answer. But in an assise to plead divers
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:33044:203"/> discents in tail, is not double, for one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer maketh an end of all, that is to deny the gift in tail, So as the matter cannot co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               <p>So is it also of two or three matters toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the general conclusion, as in debt upon an obligation to say, that he is not lettered, and the Deed was read unto hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
